## Hewlett-Packard-Analysis 

### The Purpose of Analysis
The purpose of analysis is to help HP company, to figure it out the number of upcoming retiring     people, due to their age “silver tsunami”, and find out their positions and what can be done to cover the gap without affecting the company’s course of production. Other task was to find out who is elidable for mentorship program.

### Main Findings
*Huge percent of HP employees are facing retirement. As company was established in 1939, big percent of employees are baby boomers. We filtered this data by birth year between 1952-1955.
*Most of the people who will retire have top positions such as senior engineers and senior staff.

*There is only 1500+/- people who qualify for mentorship program.
*More people are retiring then getting hired.

### Conclusion
HP Company is about to face hard times. They need to jump on and expand mentorship program for future hire. Lack of skilled workers can affect the flow of the company and with a different work culture and lack of understanding and industry experience, future generations might not be able to fulfill all the positions required. Hopefully advanced technology can replace some skills.
